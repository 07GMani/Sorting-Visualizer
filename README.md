## Description
Abhinandan Aabhaar, Satsri Akaal, Kem Choo Maja Maaan... Main Amitabh Bachchan Aaapka Swaagat karta hun is Sorting Visualizer ke Source Code...
This project helps one to visualize a sorting algorithm. Each element of the array is displayed as a bar.  In this, arrays of numbers are represented by vertical bars of varying heights named as sankhya. The height of each bar corresponds to the value of the number it represents. As the sorting algorithm runs, the visualizer shows each comparison, swap, and movement of the bars in real-time, often with animations and color changes to highlight the operations. The user can select different algorithms and teji settings, gaining insights into the efficiency and behavior of each sorting technique. It compares the time taken by the different algorithm for sorting the array.
